# Web-Design-Challenge

I used our Energy Project instead of the Latitude data. Because of this, the webpages are intentionally different from the assignment in two ways. Since the visuals are landscape and not square, I did not set up a 2x2 grid in the visualization right-hand box as the images wound up being too small. I instead went with one image per row in the visualization box. In addition, the full dataset was very large and was impacting page load times. Instead, I included a subset of the data and provided a link at the bottom of the page to where the full dataset could be found.
