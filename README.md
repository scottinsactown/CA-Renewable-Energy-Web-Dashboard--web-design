# Web-Design-Challenge

A visualization dashboard website using charts and data from a past project on California renewable energy production. 

7 pages total:
* A land page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four visualiation pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A comparison page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A data page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * Uses a bootstrap table component.
    * Data comes from a .csv file.
    
The website has a navigation menu that:
* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries).
